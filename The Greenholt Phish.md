In cyber security, the strength of a secure system is measured by its weakest link.

The weakest link is usually the **human element**; you can have the strongest and most up-to-date firewalls, IPS, and antivirus software, but still get compromised due to a phishing link clicked by an uneducated employee, or an attachment downloaded by an unaware target whose machine has access to confidential resources.


In this room, we will focus on phishing emails.


**Phishing** is a type of social engineering attacks that attempts to use the human psychology to manipulate victims into giving access of their resources or internal networks to threat actors.

Threat actors try to establish themselves as figures of authority or a close aquintance to the victim to gain his/her trust; they can also pose as a business partner or a customer to try and steal financial data or wire money into anonymous accounts or convert it into crypto currencies.

The problem with phishing is that there is no sophisticated tool that can prevent 100% of phishing attempts; with a very elegant and well-written email, you can trick at least 1 employee into interacting with your malicious links or attachments, regardless of their technical background.


In this scenario, we will be looking at a sample of a phishing email and analyze it step by step to figure out how exactly it is a phishing email:
